A simple react app, created to be the main page of my personal site <br>
**Live page:** https://josiahmatheson.com

## Details:

**Tech used:** React, Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS, HTML

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this page is very straightforward outside of two library dependencies:

- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) is used to display my each project's readme in its markdown format.
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) is used to create a react component that displays images of the projects.

### Hosting:
The [website](https://josiahmatheson.com) is hosted on a Ubuntu VM running [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)
